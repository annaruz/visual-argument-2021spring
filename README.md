This visual project was created with the software GIMP for my Composing Digital Media college course. With this graphic, I designed an argument to educate viewers on the expansiveness of the field of public health. The phrase "beyond masks and vaccines, public health impacts every aspect of your life" is centered in a color block in front of layered, partially-opaque images that represent various aspects of public health from water and air quality to using a seatbelt. All sources are listed in the "assets.md" file.
