# Prevalence of Public Health
This visual project was created with the software GIMP for my Composing Digital Media college course. With this graphic, I designed an argument to educate viewers on the expansiveness of the field of public health. The phrase "Beyond masks and vaccines, public health impacts every aspect of your life" is centered in a color block with photographs of masks and syringes above. Below the text are photographs representing some of the aspects of public health that are used in daily life such as toothbrushes representing dental care and a person running to represent physical activity. Movement is used in the placement of the photographs, and contrasting colors were chosen to create an appealing visual layout. This project was submitted in phases of three different drafts as I continued to edit it, and in-class writing and peer feedback helped me get to the position of the final draft. All sources are listed in the "assets.md" file in this repository.
